The requirements for my app and goals were to develop an app that would track the weight and store the data for the user to know exactly if they were meeting their required weight goals or not. The UI screens needed were a login screen, a screen to hold the data and charts that were used to track the weight for the user to see, and SMS messaging that would be used to send a goal made for the user. I approached the process by creating the UI screen first to see exactly what information I needed fort coding, then continued to tackle to data bases for mySQL first, then created the code for the login screen and text messaging alert. I tested the code through just running a debug on android studio, which I saw from tutorial videos was standard for making sure the functionality of the app worked well. I overcame my problems with creating by innovating and learning howe to pull the data and have the user implement to create the database. The component I thought I was most particularly good at demonstrating was the login in screen, as it was the easiest and most fluid to implement.
